# Proofs
This is my little teaching hall, where I will attempt to teach in order to gain more from my lessons!
I post the proofs I make here, anyone can view them and show/tell me if I have made a mistake.
I'll try my best to post at least one proof per week, but I like to procrastinate.
I usually use books/articles or videos to cerate these :P

Warning: I am not a professional ahahaha
